This is the code for the reproducibility project for the course CS4240 Deep Learning
We implemented the pre-processing code from the [Adaptive Feature Fusion Network for Gaze Tracking in Mobile Tablets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9412205/) paper, using the MPIIFaceGAze dataset.

The project is based on:

```
numpy==1.20.1
opencv-python==4.2.0.34
torch==1.5.0
torchvision==0.6.0
```

We have attempted to reproduce the results from the literature survey dataset ["Appearance-based Gaze Estimation With Deep Learning: A Review and Benchmark"](http://phi-ai.buaa.edu.cn/Gazehub/2D-dataset/).
